      <p class="like">
        The activities of Tikau Zakat and Waqf committee from 2002 till date has
        been inspiring and rewarding. The committee introduced many strategies
        on which Waqf funds are utilized. From the preceding table of yearly
        zakat and Waqf collections the sum of &#8358; 44,124,814 was collected
        and distributed to the needy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contain">
      <h2 class="offi">Current Challenges</h2>
      <p class="like">
        Establishment of Jumma'st Masjids: Jumma'at Masjids have sprung up
        across the nooks and crannies of the emirate. As at 2022 there are 40
        jumma'at Masjids in Tikau Emirate. Construction, expansions,
        renovations, salaries and allowances of Imams and Na'ibs, provisions of
        regalia and accessories for Imams, provision of Holy Qur'an, Islamic
        books and Journals, Workshops/retreats for Imams are being organized
        annually (specially before the mouth of Ramadan) are some of the current
        challenges of the committee.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contain">
      <h2 class="offi">Establishment and Management of Islamiyya Schools</h2>
      <p class="like">
        Before the establishment of Tikau Zakat and Waqf committee many villages
        in Tikau Emirate have no access to formal islamic education. In 2002,
        the committee started with the establishment of 10 Islamiyya schools. It
        is gratifying to note the impressive increase in the number of Islamiyya
        schools in the emirate from 10 in 2002 to 74 in 2022. With regards to
        enrolment of students, married women, and teachers.
        <br />
        These successes can be attributed to the firm commitment of his royal
        highness Mai of Tikau with support of the zakat and Waqf committee in
        propagating Islamic education throughout the emirate.
        <br />
        <br />
        It is however worthy to note that yearly increase in the number of
        Islamic schools, students/married women enrolment, teachers, school
        furniture (in villages where there are no primarys class rooms), other
        instructional materials as well as allowances for islamiyya tutors goes
        with it increasing financial burden on the Zakat and Waqf funds.

      <h2 class="offi">Routine Da'awah Activitics</h2>
      <p class="like">
        Over the years, the Zakat and Waqf committee has been collaborating with
        FOMWAN, Yobe state chapter, in conducting series of Da'awah activities
        in designated centres across the emirate. Lectures, practical
        demonstration, Questions and answers sessions on selected topics were
        delivered. Notably, in the year 2022, the committee in collaboration
        with islamic teachers from yobe state FOMWAN organization conducted a
        workshop with practical demostration titled "Jinya da wankan gawa a
        musulunci", which recieved the coverage of NTA and Sunnah Tv. The
        committee further introduced other routine Da'awah prayers, Usually
        inform of weekly pre-khudduba in all Jumma'at Mosques within the Tikau.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contain">
      <h2 class="offi">Distribution of Hijab at Subsidized Rate</h2>
      <p class="like">
        In an effort to encourage Islamic values and ensure modest Islamic dress
        code in Tikau, the Tikau Zakat and Waqf committee initiated Hijab
        distribution programmee with 50% discount. Initially, the programme
        targeted students of Islamiyya schools, but later almost all the women
        of the Tikau Emirate accepted Hijab as their mode of dressing, contrary
        to how they were before the introduction of the hijab distribution
        programme.
        <br />
        <br />
        With gratitude to Allah (S.W.A), it is worth noting that Tikau Emirate
        remains the only Emirate in the state that has an established functional
        Tikau Zakat and Waqf committee. This has attracted the attention of the
        state government which issue a letter of commendation to the Emirate in
        recognition of the tremendous efforts.
